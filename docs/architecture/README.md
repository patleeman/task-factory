# Architecture

This section documents how Task Factory is structured and how runtime lifecycle behavior works.

## Core architecture docs

- [System Architecture](./system-architecture.md) — package boundaries and responsibilities for client, server, shared types, and extension tools.
- [Runtime Flows](./runtime-flows.md) — planning flow, execution flow, and queue manager coordination.
- [State Contract (canonical)](./state-contract.md) — lifecycle modes/phases, transition rules, and enforcement invariants.
- [Architecture Decision Records](./adrs/README.md) — decision history.

## Recommended reading order

1. System Architecture
2. Runtime Flows
3. State Contract
4. ADRs (when making structural changes)
